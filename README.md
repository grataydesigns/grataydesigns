# About me

I bridge the gap between design and development by working with members of the user experience team or as a member of the user experience team to brainstorm workflows and possible components I can implement to create the base new feature to solve a user problem. Most components I build become part of a design system so the styling architecture has to be modular with reusable code and CSS variables that are easy to use. I use the same component architecture to translate design concepts into living, breathing prototypes, and iterate on interactions, animations, and details to deliver the perfect experience.
